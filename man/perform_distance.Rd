\title{Calculate Distance Metric Between Two Sequences}
\usage{
perform_distance(seq1, seq2, method = "dtw")
}
\arguments{
\item{seq1}{A numeric vector representing the first sequence.}

\item{seq2}{A numeric vector representing the second sequence.}

\item{method}{Character string specifying which distance metric to calculate.
Options are "dtw", "euclidean", "manhattan", "correlation", "area", "hausdorff".
Default is "dtw".}
}
\value{
A list containing the selected distance metric and diagnostic information:
\item{distance}{The calculated distance value}
\item{completeness}{Proportion of complete (non-NA) pairs}
\item{valid}{Logical indicating if the metric was successfully computed}
}
\description{
This function takes two sequences and calculates a selected distance metric
commonly used in trajectory analysis. Each metric handles NA values appropriately:
\enumerate{
\item DTW - uses step patterns that can skip NA values
\item Euclidean - computed only on complete pairs
\item Manhattan - computed only on complete pairs
\item Correlation - uses pairwise complete observations
\item Area - interpolates NA values using linear interpolation
\item Hausdorff - considers only non-NA values in both sequences
}
}
\examples{
seq1 <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5)
seq2 <- c(2, NA, 4, 5, 6)
# Calculate DTW distance
result <- perform_distance(seq1, seq2)
# Calculate Euclidean distance
result <- perform_distance(seq1, seq2, method = "euclidean")
print(result$distance)
print(result$completeness)
print(result$valid)
}
