Description: Tools for aligning satellite lidar data with geographic reference data.
    This package includes algorithms for minimizing positional error using
    various optimization techniques including Genetic Algorithms (GA),
    Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA).
    It supports various error metrics including Euclidean, Manhattan, DTW,
    correlation, and area-based methods.
